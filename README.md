# Blue
Vocal assistant that you can use and modify to add your own features.

A webserver is running on port 8080 to access and config Blue easily, like adding custom messages to send at an ip or control Irobot cleaner etc..(feature not completely done yet)

If you are near the Blue base and a microphone is plugged in, you can talk without opening the app on your phone by beginning your sentences by "blue".

This assistant is designed for linux so some features may not work on windows, Raspberry PI OS is not recommended, Please use Kali for ARM64 instead on your rasp.
All the commands are designed for frech people, feel free to translate to your own langage.
