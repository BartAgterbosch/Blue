# Blue
Vocal assistant that you can use and modify to add your own features.

Please modify the script and uncomment the bot setup part the first time you use Blue.py. But recomment it just after.

A webserver is running on port 8080 to access and config Blue easily, like adding custom messages to send at an ip or control Irobot cleaner etc..(feature not completely done yet)

If you are near the Blue base and a microphone is plugged in, you can talk without opening the app on your phone.
